## What is the 99 OCaml Problems Challenge?

The 99 OCaml Problems Challenge is a collection of programming exercises that cover various aspects of functional programming in OCaml. These exercises range from simple list manipulations to more complex algorithms and data structures. The challenges are a great way to explore OCaml's functional features, improve coding proficiency, and have fun while solving intriguing problems!

## How to Use This Repository

In this repository, I'll be documenting my solutions to the 99 OCaml Problems. Each problem will have its dedicated OCaml source file, and I'll strive to keep the code clean, well-documented, and efficient.

Feel free to explore the solutions and compare them with your own. Remember, there are often multiple ways to approach a problem in OCaml, and different solutions can provide valuable insights into functional programming techniques.

## How to Run the Code

If you want to test or run any of the solutions in this repository, you'll need an OCaml compiler and interpreter installed on your machine. You can get the latest version of OCaml from the [official OCaml website](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html).

Once you have OCaml set up, you can run the OCaml files using the following command:

```
ocaml filename.ml
```

Replace `filename.ml` with the name of the specific OCaml source file you want to execute.

## Contribution

I'm open to suggestions and improvements! If you find any bugs in my solutions or have more efficient ways to tackle the problems, please feel free to create an issue or a pull request. Let's learn together and improve our OCaml skills!

## Disclaimer

The solutions presented here are my personal implementations and may not be the most optimal or idiomatic. The primary goal is to learn and grow as a programmer. If you use these solutions for your own learning, make sure to understand them thoroughly and avoid copying them directly for any academic or professional purposes.

This project was inspired by Tsoding Daily's attempt, please go check him out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily).

## Let's Get Started!

I'm excited to embark on this OCaml journey and work my way through the 99 OCaml Problems. Stay tuned for updates as I make progress and complete more challenges!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
